                    <p>
                        Most of my professional information can be found on Linkedin and my resume. So this page is not for that kind of information.
                        Here, you can get to know a little bit about me and my journey. I'll give you a couple visual stats, but here you can find out 
                        who Matt is and get to know a little bit more about his story. It might even get a little real. So if you aren't prepared for it, 
                        please feel free to just download the CV by using the CV button.

                    <h5>Data Analyst<span> - Americal Excel Enterprise</span></h5>
                    <p>
                        I was a Data Analyst at a E-commerce company with a centralized focus in Amazon and Shopify. Other platforms were also used including Overstock, Walmart,
                        Ebay, and Newegg. I started off learning about 
                        how Amazon seller central worked and how gathering data and understanding what the data means 
                        can make a huge impact on company decisions.
                        The company took me in after seeing my dedication and hard work and I became one of the core memebers
                        of the company. During this time I worked closely with the Data Engineer, Software Engineer, Data Scientist, as well as
                        the CEO of the company in order to gather data and make meaningful insights that were presented during
                        the weekly company meetings. I was mainly a Data Analyst, gathering and cleaning data using Excel, R and SQL. Using statistics formulas to find out 
                        the defective rate threshold of certain items. I used R and Tableau in order to create the dashboards in order to share insights found in a beautiful fashion. I made scripts
                        using python to automate the process at work that normally would have had to be done manually. I pickedu on SQL and Python when I never learned how to code in my life by watching 
                        lots of Youtube Tutorials and endless forum scrolling on Stack Overflow and Quora. However, I had to put on many hats during this time. Aside from being an Analyst, I was also the customer Service
                        representative, the logistics specialist, the graphic designer, and so much more. it was absolutely challenging at times, but in the 
                        end it really shaped my work ethic in such a positive manner as I continued to learn and grow. During the time here I curated a strategy with my skills 
                        in order to leverage certain insights that generated the company over 1.2 million dollars a month in just our Amazon account alone. It helped me understand a lot about not only the business world,
                        but also myself.
                        Moving forward I toko the lessons from this company to heart and I truely appreciated everything they have done for me.

                    <h5>A.S. Computer Science<span> - Fullerton College</span></h5>
                    <p>
                            This was start of my college journey...again. I first attended community college in 2009, but I had no idea what I wanted to do. So I dropped out. During that time I really despised school and I was always told I was a failure growing up.  
                            I thought that going into business would be a better fit. I mostly made many decisions by myself with no guidance or help from family. What was worse is that I 
                            was too ashamed or embarassed to ask for help because I was always belittled. So naturally, this was a poor decision in my eyes looking backwards. I was always just 
                            trying the best that I could.
                            However, you can't change the past and so moving forward, after years of being in business, and doing so many odd jobs, life had other plans for me. My mother passed from Pancreatic Cancer in 2018.
                            It was one of the most difficult times of my life.
                            I lost my job, had a failed engagement, lost my best friend(my dog), and now I lost my mother. It was a stressful time, but after some greiving and soul searching, I decided to go back to school. This time, things were different.
                            I was different. But one that that was not different was, I still had no idea what I wanted to do. This gave me time to explore a little bit. I took a few classes to see if it was good fit. I talked to countless people who were actually in the field, I did a lot of research, and this time I 
                            asked for help. I attempted to dive into the field of Automotive, Electricians, Forensics, and Nursing but none if it stimulated my brain enough to get me interested. I ended up not going through with any of them.
                            Being an adult going back to school, I now understood that the past Matt did not do well because he was dumb. I know myself now that if it's not challenging enough, it's not very motivating for me. Because I love challenges.
                            I was lost in what I wanted to do now that plan A,B,C and D were no longer part of the equation. Then I took my first programming class which was Java and it peaked my interest. I then took C++ and it was
                            so much fun. I remembered working on projects with my friend until 4am to fix a simple bug that was caused by a semi colon. And even when the projects were completed, we still continued to improve upon it.
                            That's when I knew this was it. I was commited to learning about Computer Science. This guy who had a .9 GPA in highschool, went onto getting a 3.9 GPA in his college career. It would have been a 4.0 if Calculus 2 didn't kick my ass 
                            and drop my GPA. But that wasn't important. What was important was, that I did change. 
                            College in my eyes was different than how I looked it at it in the past. It was no longer a place for me to go to learn about random subjects, or to just get a letter grade, or a place to just get a piece of paper at the end.
                            College was filled with opporunity. It was an opportunity for me to learn the intangeble skills, such as socialization, adaptability working in groups with a variety of characters, being responsible with time management, stepping up and 
                            being a leader. It was an opporunity to learn about something I actually gave a shit about. It was an opporunity to prove to the ones who didn't believei in me that their opinions couldn't dictate my future. But most importantly, 
                            it was an opporunity to try hard to honor the ones that did matter. It was an opportunity to find what I loved in life and chase after my dreams. And it was an opportunity to at least finish what I started. 
                            I was happy to say I was no longer the guy from back then. I guess you could say this is my redemption story and this...is just another chapter in that book.

                    <h5>B.S. in Computer Science<span> - California State University of Fullerton</span></h5>
                    <p>
                        This was my first and last year of my undergraduate program at California State University of Fullerton.  
                        I had many tell me that I couldn't do it. That I was someone who did not belong in Computer Science. A lot of the times, this kind of 
                            feedback came from family memebers or friends that I admired or looked up to. Then I had people look down on me for going here. I was well aware that this was not the most presteige school for Computer Science.
                            I did get accepted into better schools, but it was all I could realistically afford at the time given my situtaiton. However, none of that mattered. It was still a great education. And to me it didn't matter where you went, 
                            what mattered is how you make of the time spent there. All of my professors were very helpful and I learned so much from their experiences. To me it didn't matter what school I ended up in. What mattered is that I got an education. 
                            I was grateful to be in a place in my life where I could say I went to obtain my Bachelors Degree. So here I was, still learning about algorithms, file structures and databases design, operating systems, compilers, 
                            networking, and so much more. I worked 2-3 jobs and still took 5-6 classes each semester. This was difficult, but I've been through tough times so I just strapped myself in and said "lets do this". 
                            I thought of wanting to take a fast route to my goal by possibly taking a bootcamp, but I'm glad I didn't. There was absolutely no way that I could learn all that I did in a few months. I may not use everything I've learned 
                            in a specific role, but I always believed that knowing a little bit about everything could further enchance my understanding of whatever craft I choose to do. I would have known things that others did not which might 
                            provide me a unique perspective on how two different data points can be linked. I learned this when I took intro to C, which taught me about network sockets and just having more strict coding practices. 
                            My future classes became easy, whereas others were lost. I also took higher level statistics and probability instead of certain electives. I did it because I just fell in love with math. But little did I know that kind 
                            of mathematics could open doors for me in the realm of Data Science and Machine Learning. Ultimately that it shapes how I think about how I would solve problems and think of programming in a math oriented brain. Computer Science 
                            and Math were intertwined. Maybe I just had an amazing professor, but I was a guy who grew up an artist saying I am not a math person. The thought of math sickened me. But little did I know, I realized the beautiful 
                            relationship between the two. My experience is my own and I can't speak for others. But going to this University further fed my skills in adaptability, analytical thinking, problem solving, leadership skills, 
                            resilience, having grace, and so much more. 
                            I know you may not understand exactly what I went through, but it was a heavy burden to bear. I was the only male in my family line that finished college. There were so many times I wanted 
                            to just give up. But I came too far to give up now, right? Graduating was not just for my career, it was also for myself. Because not many believed in me. Because I was told I was words like worthless, or a failure. 
                            Now I was the first male of my family to graduate from a 4 year University. With a degree I had no idea I could acheive. The moment brought me back to 2009, when I saw a news article about Google's new headquarters in Santa
                            Monica. It was showing the type of environment that those employees worked in. I thought to myself, I wish I could work in a place like that. I wish I could work with people like that. But I remembered shutting myself down 
                            thinking, "but im not smart enough for that". I'm not saying I'm destined to work at google, but life is short. It's too short to not go after your dreams. I may not know where I'll end up, but one thing is for certain is 
                            that I will always keep fighting. And always, keep learning.
